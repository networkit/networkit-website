===========
Get Started
===========

Take a look at `Installation`_ or `Build NetworKit from Source`_ in order to install NetworKit as a Python3 package or directly build it from source.

With NetworKit as a Python extension module, you get access to native high-performance code and can at the same time work interactively in the Python ecosystem.
Although the standard Python interpreter works fine, we recommend `IPython <http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ as a great environment for scientific
workflows. View the `IPython Quickstart Guide`_ for installation instructions and how to use NetworKit with IPython.

Once you have installed NetworKit, please make sure to check out our
`NetworKit UserGuide <https://github.com/kit-parco/networkit/blob/Dev/notebooks/User-Guide.ipynb>`_ for an overview of the features provided
in NetworKit.

Make sure Python3 and pip3, the python package manager, are installed on your system. You'll need the tkinter dependency for python3. Afterwards, pip3 can be used to install networkit.

.. code-block:: bash

  # On Ubuntu or equivalent, python3 is pre-installed.

  # Install pip3 (if needed) and tkinter dependency
  sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-tk

  # Install networkit
  pip3 install networkit

.. _macOS:

macOS
-----

Use Homebrew to install Python3 if you haven't done so before. Afterwards, pip3 can be used to install networkit.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Install Homebrew (if needed)
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

  # Install python3 and pip3 with Homebrew (if needed)
  brew install python3

  # Install networkit
  pip3 install networkit

.. _Windows 10:

Windows 10
^^^^^^^^^^

With the introduction of Windows 10, Microsoft offers native support for Linux binaries through a compatibility layer called `Linux Subsystem for Windows <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_. Please see the `installation instructions <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_ on how to install the Linux Subsystem on your machine.

The Linux Subsystem is fully compatible with NetworKit. After a successful installation, simply **open a new command line** and start a new bash shell.

.. code-block:: bash

  bash

The remainder of the installation is similar to the installation process on Linux except for the addition of the `python3-dev` package.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Install pip3, tkinter & dev dependencies
  sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-tk python3-dev

  # Install networkit
  pip3 install networkit

.. _Build NetworKit from Source:

Build NetworKit from Source
===========================

You can clone NetworKit from `GitHub <https://github.com/kit-parco/networkit>`_ with git or download the source code as a `zip file <https://github.com/kit-parco/networkit/archive/master.zip>`_.

.. _Build Requirements:

Requirements
------------

You will need the following software to build NetworKit as a Python package from source:

- A modern C++ compiler, e.g.: `g++ <https://gcc.gnu.org>`_ (>= 4.8) or `clang++ <http://clang.llvm.org>`_ (>= 3.7)
- `SCons <http://scons.org>`_: Please note that SCons is only available for Python 2. For the different build targets, SCons is mandatory.
- `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ (>= 0.21): Only needed by developers.
- `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_ (only needed if you want to build the unit tests, which is recommended)

Build the Python Package
------------------------

This section describes how to build NetworKit including the Python functionality. If you do not wish to install NetworKit as a Python package, please refer
to `Build the C++ Backend`_.

For building NetworKit including the Python functionality, make sure to also install the software from the `Installation Requirements`_.

After all requirements are installed, switch to the top folder of NetworKit and run the script *setup.py* with the following options:

.. code-block:: bash

	python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace [--optimize=V] [-jX]

The script will call SCons to compile NetworKit as a library and then build the extensions in the folder *src/python*. By default, NetworKit will be built with
the amount of available cores in optimized mode. It is possible to add the options :code:`--optimize=V` and :code:`-jN` the same way it can be done to a manual
SCons call, to specify the optimization level and the number of threads used for compilation. The setup script provides more functionality and can be used with
pip aswell:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip3 install -e ./

will compile NetworKit, build the extensions and on top of that temporarily install NetworKit so that it is available on the whole system. This can be undone by
calling :code:`pip3 uninstall networkit`.

.. code-block:: bash

	python3 setup.py clean [--optimize=V]

will remove the extensions and its build folder as well as call SCons to remove the NetworKit library and its build folder specified by :code:`--optimize=V`.

Note: All of the above installation command may require root privileges depending on your system, so try this accordingly. If you do not have root privileges,
add :code:`--user` to your command.


Build the C++ Backend
---------------------

In case you do not need NetworKit's Python functionality, this section describes how to build the C++ parts only.

We recommend SCons for building the C++ part of NetworKit. Individual settings for your environment will be read from a configuration file. As an example, the
file *build.conf.example* is provided. Copy this to *build.conf* and edit your environment settings. Then call Scons.

The call to SCons has the following options:

.. code-block:: bash

	scons --optimize=<level> --target=<target>

where :code:`<level>` can be

- :code:`Dbg` debug
- :code:`Opt` optimized
- :code:`Pro` profiling

and :code:`target` can be

- :code:`Core` build NetworKit as a library, required for the Python extension through Cython.
- :code:`Tests` build executable for the unit tests (requires GoogleTest).
- :code:`Lib` build NetworKit as a (static) library and create symbolic links.
- :code:`SharedLib` build NetworKit as a shared library and create symbolic links.

For example, to build NetworKit as an optimized (static) library, run

.. code-block:: bash

	scons --optimize=Opt --target=Lib

To speed up the compilation on a multicore machine, you can append :code:`-jX` where *X* denotes the number of threads to compile with.

Logging is enabled by default. If you want to disable logging functionality, add the following to your scons call:

.. code-block:: bash

	--logging=no


Building NetworKit as a Library
-------------------------------

It is also possible to use NetworKit as a library. Therefore, choose the target `Lib` or `SharedLib` when compiling NetworKit. The include directives in your C++\-application
look like the following

.. code-block:: C

	#include <NetworKit/graph/Graph.h>

NetworKit in the directory `include` is a symlink to the directory `networkit/cpp`, so the directory structure from the repository is valid. To compile your
application, you need to add the paths for the header files and the location of the library. Note, that it is possible to link the different builds
(debug, profiling, optimized) of the library. There is a simple source file to demonstrate this. Feel free to compile `LibDemo.cpp` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

	g++ -o LibDemo -std=c++11 -I/path/to/repo/include -L/path/to/repo LibDemo.cpp -lNetworKit -fopenmp

Tests
=====

You actually do not need to build and run our unit tests. However, if you experience any issues with NetworKit, you might want to check, if NetworKit runs properly.
Please refer to the `Unit Tests and Testing <https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/DevGuide.html#devguide-unittests>`_ section in our `NetworKit Development Guide <https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/DevGuide.html#devGuide>`_.

.. _IPython Quickstart Guide:

Use NetworKit with IPython
==========================

First make sure you have installed IPython, e.g. via pip: :code:`pip3 install ipython`.

IPython Terminal
----------------

If you want to use NetworKit in the IPython terminal, type the following commands in your OS terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

	ipython3

.. code-block:: python

	from networkit import *

The first line opens the IPython terminal. The second line imports the *networkit* Python module. After that, you should be able to use NetworKit interactively.
For usage examples, refer to the `NetworKit UserGuide <https://github.com/kit-parco/networkit/blob/Dev/notebooks/User-Guide.ipynb>`_.

IPython Notebook/Jupyter
------------------------

Additionally, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with NetworKit through experimenting with the interactive IPython Notebook `NetworKit_UserGuide.ipynb` located
in the folder `Doc/Notebooks`. The user guide also introduces a large portion of NetworKits functionality with usage examples. To display and work with these notebooks,
you have to install jupyter and start a local notebook server from the terminal with:

.. code-block:: bash

	jupyter/ipython3 notebook

If you run into any problems with jupyter, head over to the `jupyter documentation <http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_. If the notebook server starts as it is supposed to, your default browser should open a web interface or you have to open it manually. Then you can add `NetworKit_UserGuide.ipynb` from the above mentioned location or browse to the location through the web interface.

To show plots within the notebooks, place the following two lines at the beginning of your notebook:

.. code-block:: python

	%matplotlib inline
	matplotlib.pyplot as plt

**Note:** Instead of running jupyter, it may still be possible to run :code:`ipython3 notebook`. However, the notebook functionality of the ipython package is deprecated and has been moved to jupyter, which we strongly recommend.

NetworKit Usage Example
=======================

Now that you are done installing NetworKit, you might want to try the following example:

.. code-block:: python

	>>> from networkit import *
	>>> g = generators.HyperbolicGenerator(1e5).generate()
	>>> overview(g)
	Network Properties for:		G#5
	nodes, edges			100000, 300036
	directed?			False
	weighted?			False
	isolated nodes			1815
	self-loops			0
	density				0.000060
	clustering coefficient		0.720003
	min/max/avg degree		0, 1174, 6.000720
	degree assortativity		0.001383
	number of connected components	4026
	size of largest component	78387 (78.39 %)

	>>> communities = community.detectCommunities(g, inspect=True)
	PLM(balanced,pc,turbo) detected communities in 0.14902853965759277 [s]
	solution properties:
	-------------------  -----------
	# communities        4253
	min community size      1
	max community size   1821
	avg. community size    23.5128
	modularity              0.987991
	-------------------  -----------

Known Issues
============

- Mac OS X 10.10 "Yosemite": Some users have reported compilation problems on Yosemite with g++ 4.9. The compiler errors mention register problems.
  While the exact reason remains unclear, the actual issue seems to be that the compiler tries to perform a dual architecture build.
  Fix: Enforce a 64-bit build by prepending :code:`ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"` to your setup/pip command, e.g. as in
  :code:`sudo ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace -j4` or :code:`sudo ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" pip3 install networkit`.

-	NetworKit has not yet been successfully built on **Windows 8 and below** in a reproducible way. This is partially due to the fact that Windows ships without a C++ compiler which is
	necessary to build	the Python extensions. Even with the Visual C++ Redistributable our attempts were not successful. Any help is appreciated. It may
	be possible to build NetworKit as a library on Windows in environments like MinGW or Cygwin.

-	Some algorithms (e.g. StronglyConnectedComponents) are implemented in a recursive manner and for large input may exceed the default stack size on your platform.
	To work around this issue, you can lift the stack size limit for your terminal process and subsequent child processes with :code:`ulimit -s unlimited` or :code:`ulimit -Hs` (to the hard limit if there is one). It is also possible to change resource limits from Python directly with :code:`import resource; resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_STACK, (-1, -1))`.
-	On macOS, it can happen that the g++ compiler is unable to locate specific Linux-based header files. An example would be an error during the compilation of a C++ header which includes :code:`stdint`. This can generate the following error message: :code:`fatal error: sys/_types/_int8_t.h: No such file or directory`. This error will most likely happen on new systems or after a major system upgrade. In this case you need to (again) install the Xcode command line tools: :code:`xcode-select --install`. Afterwards the code should compile completely.
