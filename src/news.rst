December 19, 2018: **NetworKit 5.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major features:

- New algorithm for approximating of the betweenness centrality of all the nodes of a graph or of the top-k nodes with highest betweenness centrality based on: "KADABRA is an ADaptive Algorithm for Betweenness via Random Approximation", M. Borassi, E. Natale. Presented at ESA 2016.
- New Mocnik graph generator based on: "Modelling Spatial Structures", F.B. Mocnik, A. Frank. Presented at COSIT 2015.
- New build system based on CMake.
- Support for C++ build on Windows.

Minor changes:

- Parallel Erdos Reny graph generator.
- NetworKit installation via pip: missing packages will be automatically downloaded.
- Partition: equality between partitions can be quickly checked via hashing.
- Closeness: generalized definition of Closeness centrality so it can be computed also on disconnected graphs.
- Aux::PrioQueue allows read access to its elements via iterators.
- Graph class: new reductions allow to compute the maximum (weighted) degree of a graph in parallel.

June 25, 2018: **NetworKit 4.6 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Today we announce the next version of NetworKit, the open-source toolkit for large-scale network analysis.
NetworKit is a Python package, with performance-critical algorithms implemented in C++/OpenMP.

**Release notes**

Major features:

- Dynamic algorithm for keeping track of k nodes with highest closeness centrality (based on “Computing Top-k Closeness Centrality in Fully-dynamic Graphs”, P. Bisenius, E. Bergamini, E. Angriman and H. Meyerhenke. Presented at ALENEX 2018).
- Dynamic algorithm to keep track of k nodes with highest Katz centrality (based on “Scalable Katz Ranking Computation in Large Static and Dynamic Graphs”, A. van der Grinten, E. Bergamini, O. Green, D. A. Bader and H. Meyerhenke.).
- Curveball graph randomization algorithm based on “Parallel and I/O-efficient Randomisation of Massive Networks using Global Curveball Trades”, C. J. Carstens, M. Hamann, U. Meyer, M. Penschuck, H. Tran and D. Wagner.
- Algorithm for finding the group of nodes with highest betweenness centrality (based  on “Scalable Betweenness Centrality Maximization via Sampling”, A. Mahmoody, C. E. Tsourakakis, E. Upfal).
- Algorithm for finding the group of nodes with highest group degree based on the definition in “The Centrality of Groups and Classes”, M.G. Everett, S.P. Borgatti.
- Algorithm for finding all the biconnected components of a graph based on “Algorithm 447: efficient algorithms for graph manipulation”, J. Hopcroft, R. Tarjan.
- Support for binary graph I/O: Support for graphs exported by Thrill (see https://github.com/thrill/thrill), and Implementation of binary partition readers and writers that are potentially faster than their text-based counterparts.

Minor changes:

- All algorithms for finding the top-k (harmonic) closeness can also return all the nodes whose centrality is equal to the k-th highest. This behaviour can be triggered by parameter passed in the constructor of the class.
- Faster KONECT and SNAP graph readers: roughly 2x speedup on the previous readers.
- Greatly improved running time of NetworKit’s unit tests.
- Size reduction of the “input” folder. In case of space constraints, we suggest to do a shallow clone of the NetworKit repository: git clone --depth=1 http://github.com/kit-parco/networkit

December 13, 2016: **NetworKit 4.2 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Today we announce the next version of NetworKit, the open-source toolkit for large-scale network analysis. NetworKit is a Python package, with performance-critical algorithms implemented in C++/OpenMP.

**Release notes**

Major:

- New graph drawing algorithm for the Maxent-stress model; the algorithm can layout even large graphs quickly. It follows the paper by Gansner et al. with some modifications; the biggest deviation is the use of the LAMG solver for the Laplacian linear systems
- Parallel implementation for the approximation of the neighborhood function; class has been refactored from ApproxNeighborhoodFunction to NeighborhoodFunctionApproximation.
- New heuristic algorithm for the neighborhood function. It is based on sampling and the breadth-first search and offers more flexibility with regards to the tradeoff between running time and accuracy as the number of samples can be specified by the user. It is also much faster than the approximation algorithm for networks with a high diameter (e.g. road networks).

Minor:

- Iterative implementation of components.StronglyConnectedComponents, which is now the new default. For graphs where edges have been deleted, it is recommended to use the recursive implementation, which is still available.
- Removed heuristic for vertex diameter estimation from centrality.ApproxBetweenness (now the vertex diameter is estimated as suggested in Riondato, Kornaropoulos: Fast approximation of betweenness centrality through sampling)
- Refactoring of the approximation algorithms in the distance group. ApproxNAME -> NAMEApproximation.
- Simplified installation procedure: Install required dependencies automatically

Note: You can control which C++ compiler the setup.py of the networkit package is supposed to use with e.g. :code:`CXX=clang++ pip install networkit`. This may be helpful when the setup fails to detect the compiler.
